In the project, emails are often used to notify abnormal logs, but this requires configuring STMP in the project, as well as the email address that needs to receive emails. However, when the email address changes, it is necessary to modify the project's configuration file. Or due to network restrictions, STMP cannot be configured.

This project uses an HTTP interface as an alternative to STMP. It only needs to configure the STMP and the email address that needs to receive emails within this project to achieve email sending.

Supports GET and POST requests.

Example of GET request:

```powershell
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:12566/sendMail?token=99eaf30feb23e28057367431d820cf319915792921d9cf21b5f761fb75433225&content=this%20is%20a%20test'
```

Example of POST request:

```powershell
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:12566/sendMail' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'token=99eaf30feb23e28057367431d820cf319915792921d9cf21b5f761fb75433225' \
--data-urlencode 'content=this is a test'
```

Sending an email with attachments:

```powershell
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:12566/sendMail' \
--form 'files=@"/111111.txt"' \
--form 'files=@"/22222222222222.txt"' \
--form 'token="d6a1ee40c5bad981461643f5404a305a2e3f480cc6fcf65ba98efb63ce32d471"' \
--form 'content="1212"'
```

In fact, it is a simple form submission, so different languages and platforms can make good use of this project.

Parameter description:

- token: Obtained by manually adding in the management interface, the token is a unique value, bound with STMP and the email address to be received.
- content: Email content.
- subject: Email subject. When a token is generated, a subject is also set. When the parameter is empty, the subject set at the time of token generation will be used.
- files: Email files, support for multiple files.

Usage method:

You can directly download the compiled version from the following link:

[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/chuccp/d-mail/releases)

After decompression, you can run it directly. The default port number is 12566. A configuration file will be generated, and you can modify the port number in the configuration file. After modification, restart to use the modified port number.

After starting, you can enter the management system with ip:12566.

System configuration:

When entering the management system for the first time, you need to configure the database and the background management account. The database currently supports sqlite and mysql.

![initial](initial.png "initial")

Add STMP address

![STMP](STMP.png "STMP")

Add the email address to receive emails

![mail](mail.png "mail")

Add Token

![token](token.png "token")

After adding, you can send messages to the mailbox through the token.

Configuration file description:

After the program runs, it will automatically generate a configuration file.
